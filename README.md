# Java 8 Exercise-1

## Program1

- Problem Statement: Check whether given list of strings contains only alphabets or not

- Given a list of strings, check whether each string in list contains only alphabets or not using lambda expressions

- This exercise contains a class named AlphabetChecker with the following method:

    **checkAlphabets(List<String>) : String**
  - Should accept list of strings as input
  - Should return "Give proper input not empty list" if given list is empty
  - Should check whether given list of strings contains all alphabets as charcters or not using lambda expressions
  - Should return "Given list contains only alphabet strings" if list contains only alphabet strings
  - Should return "Given list contains non alphabet strings" if list contains non alphabet strings        
      
   ***Example:***
 ~~~
    Sample Input:
    [Java,code]
    
    Expected Output:   
    Given list contains only alphabet strings
~~~
~~~
    Sample Input:
    [Java!!,Code**]
      
    Expected Output:
    Given list contains non alphabet strings
~~~
~~~
    Sample Input:
    []
    Expected Output:
    Give proper input not empty list
 ~~~

## Program2
 - Problem Statement: Find the list of strings which start with letter I in the given list of strings ##
- Given a list of strings, find the list of strings which start with letter I in the given strings using Predicate Functional Interface
- This exercise contains a class named PredicateFunctionalInterface with the following method:
    **+findPattern(List<String>) : List<String>**
    - Should accept list of strings as input  
    - Should find the list of strings which start with letter I in the given strings 
    - Should return list of strings which start with letter I in the given strings as output
    - Should return empty list if no such string is found which start with letter I
    - Should avoid the redundancy among the strings in output
        
        ***Example:***
  ~~~
    Sample Input:
    [Icecream,Water,Ice,Gas,Ice]
    
    Expected Output:   
    [Icecream,Ice]
~~~

## Program3

-  Problem Statement: Find Total of a grocery cart including taxes using lambda expression

- Given a Map and Double find total purchase cost including taxes by iterating through the Map using lambda expression
- This exercise contains a class named CartCheckout with the following method:**

***+billGenerator(Map<String, BigDecimal>, Double) : String*** 
- Should take a Map and Double as input and return a String as result
- Should validate the input Map by checking it is empty and return error String if it is empty     
- Should return error String when Map contains null or empty or blank space as a value      
- Should return error String when the Double is negative or null              

***Example:***

    Sample Input:
    {Apple=54, Grapes=36.78, Papaya=27.89, Orange=23.6, Banana=10.2}, 10.5     
    
    Expected Output:
    "168.47935"
--------------------------------------------------------
    Sample Input:
    {}, 13
        
    Expected Output:
    "The cart Map is empty"
--------------------------------------------------------
    Sample Input:
    {Apple=54, Grapes=36.78, Papaya=27.89, Orange=23.6, Banana=10.2}, -2.5
        
    Expected Output:
    "The taxPercent cannot be negative"
--------------------------------------------------------
    Sample Input:
    {Apple=54, Grapes=36.78, Papaya=27.89, Orange=23.6, Banana=10.2}, null
        
    Expected Output:
    "The taxPercent cannot be null"
